# Notes on Handmade Hero
I'm rewatching some of Handmade Hero at the beginning. Here below are some my notes in regard. 

## HH Day 3

11:00 There's no reason for RAII in window code since Windows is taking care of it.
14:40 "This is a global for now, one day we're gonna move it." suuure casey. Still not sure what exactly can be done instead of it.
19:54 "Static also defines a function to be local to the [Translation unit] it's in".
21:00 "static variables are zeroed out automatically"
22:40 "GDI is Windows' graphic API, and we want to interface with it as little as possible"
23:51 "DIB stands for 'Device-independent Bitmap'"
